# HELCOM Eutrophication Assessment Tool (HEAT)

Assessment units are defined by HELCOM comtracting parties. An assessment units can have multiple indicators. Each indicator can have different temporal (months) and spatial (depths) coverage and reference values within the different assessment units. 

### Assessment Units

### Station Samples

### Indicator Definitions

### Common Indicators

- Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN)
- Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus (DIP)
- Chlorophyll a
- Secchi Depth
- Oxygen Debt
- Total Nitrogen (TN)
- Total Phosphorus (TP)
- Cyanobacteria Bloom Index (CyaBI)

### Abbreviations

- ES = Eutrophication Status
- ES_SD = Standard Deviation
- ES_N = Number of Observations
- ES_N_Min = Minimum Number of Observations any given year
